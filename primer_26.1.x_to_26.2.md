## Pack Changes[​](#pack-changes "Direct link to Pack Changes")

There are a number of user-facing changes that are part of vanilla which are not discussed below that may be relevant to modders. You can find a list of them on [Misode's version changelog](https://misode.github.io/versions/?id=26.2&tab=changelog).

## Too Many Rendering Changes[​](#too-many-rendering-changes "Direct link to Too Many Rendering Changes")

### Vulkan[​](#vulkan "Direct link to Vulkan")

Vanilla has added support for the Vulkan graphics API, which can be set in the options menu. As such, for all classes in `com.mojang.blaze3d.opengl`, there is generally a parallel found in `com.mojang.blaze3d.vulkan`. With this change, more of the Blaze3d components has been generalized further.

### Blend Factors[​](#blend-factors "Direct link to Blend Factors")

`DestFactor` and `SourceFactor` have been combined into a single `BlendFactor`, which is used within `BlendEquation`s and `BlendFunction`s. How these `BlendFactor`s are applied is through `BlendOp`, which defines the operation to merge the source and destination. `BlendOp#ADD` is used as a default when not specified in a `BlendFunction`.

### GPU Formats[​](#gpu-formats "Direct link to GPU Formats")

`TextureFormat` and the buffer formats of `VertexFormatElement` have been replaced by the `GpuFormat` enum. The names of each enum entry can be broken down into three components: a channel with their bit size, an underscore, and finally the data type. Here are some examples:

-   `R8_UNORM`: An unsigned normalized value with a single 8-bit red channel.
-   `RGBA32_SINT`: A signed integer with 32-bit red, green, blue, and alpha channels.
-   `D32_FLOAT_S8_UINT`: A float with a 32-bit depth channel, and a unsigned integer with an 8-bit stencil channel.

The previous data types of `RGBA8`, `RED8`, `RED8I`, `DEPTH32` can be represented using one of these `GpuFormat`s, though their mappings do not have one-to-one parity for the GL codes previously used.

### Rewriting Vertex Formats[​](#rewriting-vertex-formats "Direct link to Rewriting Vertex Formats")

`VertexFormat` along with `VertexFormatElement` has been partially rewritten into a more dynamic framework. There is no longer a set of existing `VertexFormatElement`s. Instead, the elements are constructed when building the `VertexFormat` by adding attributes via `$Builder#addAttribute`. A `VertexFormat` can define at most sixteen elements or attributes, each providing at least the name and `GpuFormat`.

`VertexFormat$IndexType` and `VertexFormat$Mode` have also been moved into their own `IndexType` and `PrimitiveTopology` enums, respectively. This is because `RenderPipeline`s can now define up to sixteen vertex buffers with different `VertexFormat`s, but must be applied to the same `PrimitiveTopology`.

### Multiple Color Target States[​](#multiple-color-target-states "Direct link to Multiple Color Target States")

With this expansion, `RenderPipeline`s can also specify up to eight `ColorTargetState`s. This must match the number of color attachments specified when creating a `RenderPass` (typically 1 in vanilla usecases).

### Bind Group Layouts[​](#bind-group-layouts "Direct link to Bind Group Layouts")

`BindGroupLayout` is a collection of sampler names and `$UniformDescription`s, replacing the single list of sampler names and `RenderPipeline#UniformDescription`. Due to this separate object, `RenderPipeline$Snippet`s that were made up of only samplers and uniforms are now decoupled, allowing for a modular, non-repeatable implementation when dealing with many pipelines and layouts. All vanilla layouts are stored in `BindGroupLayouts` and are attached to a `RenderPipeline` via `RenderPipeline$Builder#withBindGroupLayout`.

```
public static final BindGroupLayout EXAMPLE_LAYOUT = BindGroupLayout.builder()    // Specifies that the shaders have a 'Sampler0' sampler    .withSampler("Sampler0")    // Specifies that the shaders have access to the 'Globals' uniform    .withUniform("Globals", UniformType.UNIFORM_BUFFER)    .build();public static final RenderPipeline EXAMPLE_PIPELINE = RenderPipeline.builder()    .withLocation(Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "pipeline/example"))    .withVertexShader(Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_shader"))    .withFragmentShader(Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_shader"))    .withVertexFormat(DefaultVertexFormat.ENTITY, VertexFormat.Mode.QUADS)    // Specify the layouts to use    .withBindGroupLayout(EXAMPLE_LAYOUT)    // Can use multiple layouts    .withBindGroupLayout(BindGroupLayouts.MATRICES_PROJECTION)    .build();
```

Note that all `BindGroupLayout`s added to a `RenderPipeline` must not contain any duplicate entries (e.g. two shaders named `Sampler0`, two uniforms named `Globals`) and by extension the same `BindGroupLayout` multiple times, or an error will be thrown during the shader compilation process.

### Render Areas[​](#render-areas "Direct link to Render Areas")

`RenderPass`es can now define a rectangle within a texture to draw its data to via `CommandEncoder#createRenderPass`. If this not specified, it defaults to the size of the color `GpuTextureView`.

### Replacing `ChatFormatting` in Components[​](#replacing-chatformatting-in-components "Direct link to replacing-chatformatting-in-components")

`ChatFormatting` has been mostly gutted in favor of using `Style` for `Component`s. The text color can be set via `Style#withColor`, while the formatting can be set using `withBold`, `withItalic`, `withUnderlined`, `withStrikethrough`, and `withObfuscated`. `ChatFormatting#RESET` is the same as using a different component.

### Gui Reorganization[​](#gui-reorganization "Direct link to Gui Reorganization")

The `Gui` class has been reorganized to handle all of the components of the graphical user interface (as the name implies). As such, fields like the current `Screen` or `ChatListener` have been moved off of their previous class (e.g. `Minecraft`) and into `Gui`. Additionally, the in-game heads-up display has been moved into a separate class called `Hud`, which `Gui` takes in.

As such, some field and method calls will need to go through `Gui` or `Hud`:

```
// Getting the current screen- Minecraft.getInstance().screen+ Minecraft.getInstance().gui.screen()// Setting the overlay message- Minecraft.getInstance().gui.setOverlayMessage(...)+ Minecraft.getInstance().gui.hud.setOverlayMessage(...)
```

### Font Preparations[​](#font-preparations "Direct link to Font Preparations")

`Font` draw methods have been completely removed, and instead need to be prepared and handled manually. This should only be done if your text cannot be submitted as a feature via `OrderedSubmitNodeCollector#submitText`.

The text rendering pipeline works like so: the `Font` prepares the text into a `$PreparedText`, which can visit the glyphs in the string. Then, a `$GlyphVisitor` loops through all the glyph components, which typically call `$GlyphVisitor#acceptRenderable`. `acceptRenderable` is where the text is uploaded to the buffer, ready to be drawn to the screen.

```
// Font has `prepareText` if don't want to implement the glyph parsing manually// For some Font fontFont.PreparedText text = font.prepareText(    // The text to draw    "Hello world!",    // The position of the text on the string    0, 0,    // The color of the text    0xFF00FF00,    // Whether to draw the drop shadow    false,    // The background color of the text    0);// We can create a glyph visitor to loop through the text componentspublic class ExampleVisitor implements Font.GlyphVisitor {    @Override    public void acceptRenderable(TextRenderable renderable) {        // Both glyphs and effects call this by default        // If you want more specialized rendering, override:        // - 'acceptGlyph' for text characters        // - 'acceptEffect' for any effects applied to the characters        // Render to the buffer        VertexConsumer buffer = Minecraft.getInstance().gameRenderer.renderBuffers().bufferSource()            .getBuffer(renderable.renderType(Font.DisplayMode.NORMAL);        renderable.render(new Matrix4f(), buffer, 0xF000F0, false);    }}// Then, we can visit all the renderables in our prepared text,// which will upload them to the buffer.text.visit(new ExampleVisitor());
```

### Submitting Gizmos[​](#submitting-gizmos "Direct link to Submitting Gizmos")

Gizmos are now rendered using the `GizmoFeatureRenderer`. Gizmos that do not call `GizmoProperties#setAlwaysOnTop` are render after translucents but before the translucent terrain features, while those that do are rendered after all other features.

### Feature Rendering: The Takeover[​](#feature-rendering-the-takeover "Direct link to Feature Rendering: The Takeover")

The feature rendering system has been overhauled to completely replace `MultiBufferSource` and any direct vertex uploads outside of vanilla chunk rendering.

For users of the system, `FeatureRenderDispatcher` now takes in a `SubmitNodeStorage` as part of its render methods. This allows for a specific subset of features to be rendered depending on user implementation rather than only at vanilla entrypoints:

```
// Create your own storage to submit elements toSubmitNodeStorage collector = new SubmitNodeStorage();collector.submitModel(...);// Render the features through the dispatcherMinecraft.getInstance().gameRenderer.featureRenderDispatcher().renderAllFeatures(collector);// If you need more granular control of when individual passes should be rendered,// you can use `FeatureRenderDispatcher#prepareFrame` instead.FeatureRenderDispatcher.PreparedFrame frame = Minecraft.getInstance()    .gameRenderer.featureRenderDispatcher().prepareFrame(collector);frame.executeSolid(); // Replaces `renderSolidFeatures`frame.executeTranslucent(); // Replaces `renderTranslucentFeatures`frame.executeTranslucentAfterTerrain(); // Replaces `renderTranslucentParticles`frame.executeAlwaysOnTop(); // Replaces gizmo rendering// The frame must be closed once finished.frame.close();
```

For modders that want to create custom features outside of the already existing submissions, three things a required: a `SubmitNode` to represent the data of the submitted feature, the `FeatureRenderPhase`(s) to store the `SubmitNode`s and supply them to the correct renderer, and the `FeatureRenderer` responsible for rendering the submissions.

A `SubmitNode` is, as the name implies, a node for some submitted element. It holds a record of the submitted data that is used by the specified `FeatureRenderer`. `SubmitNode#featureType` is used to link the node to the `FeatureRenderer` that should be used.

`SubmitNode` contains two other useful subtypes: `TranslucentSubmit`, which specifies the squared distance to the camera for ordering (`distanceToCameraSq`); and `BatchableSubmit`, which just groups similar features together using the `batchKey` such that they are rendered one after the other.

```
// The node should contain whatever data is necessary to properly render// the object.public record ExampleSubmit(Matrix4fc pose, RenderType type, ...) implements TranslucentSubmit, BatchableSubmit {    @Override    public FeatureRendererType<? extends TranslucentSubmit> featureType() {        // The identifier for our feature renderer.    }    @Override    public Object batchKey() {        // The batch key should be an object that allows the renderer or        // phase to hold its state for as long as possible before switching.        return this.type;    }    @Override    public float distanceToCameraSq() {        // Compute the camera distance.        return TranslucentSubmit.computeDistanceToCameraSq(this.pose);    }}
```

The `FeatureRenderPhase` is then responsible for collecting these submissions and supplying them to an `$Output` for rendering. `FeatureRenderPhase` defines three methods: `submit` which is what the `OrderedSubmitNodeCollector#submit*` methods delegate to, `isEmpty` for checking if there are any submissions to render, and `sortInto` for passing the submissions to their appropriate group via `$Output#accept`.

If you are making use of `SubmitNode` or `TranslucentSubmit` with no additional sorting behavior, then you can instead make use of `SimpleFeatureRenderPhase` and `TranslucentFeatureRenderPhase`, respectively. Alternatively, you can instead submit to an existing render phase in `SubmitNodeCollection`. It purely depends on how much the render order of your elements matter.

```
// Assume we have some method of injecting into `SubmitNodeCollection` collection// `TranslucentFeatureRenderPhase` is used because of `TranslucentSubmit`public final TranslucentFeatureRenderPhase examplePhase = new TranslucentFeatureRenderPhase();// Assuming we have some method of making `SubmitNodeCollection#allPhases` mutable// The order of the phases in this list does not matter. It is only used by the// `SubmitNodeStorage` to know what phases can be rendered.collection.allPhases.add(examplePhase);
```

Finally, there is the `FeatureRenderer` used to render the submitted elements to the desired output. The rendering process is broken into two sections: preparation and execution.

The preparation section is responsible for turning the submitted elements into an intermediate state, usually buffer data stored in the `StagedVertexBuffer`. Preparation can be broken into three parts: `beginPrepare` for setting up any state required to generate the intermediate buffer data, `prepareGroup` for creating the draw calls to generate the intermediate buffer data, and `finishPrepare` to restore the initial state and setup anything for the execution section. The `StagedVertexBuffer` is uploaded after the preparation stage has been completed, so the only thing that should be stored during `prepareGroup` is the draw reference (for `StagedVertexBuffer` this is `StagedVertexBuffer$Draw`).

The execution section is responsible for drawing the intermediate buffer data to the desired output (e.g. `RenderTarget`). Execution can be broken into two parts: `executeGroup` for using a `RenderPass` to draw the target color and depth texture, and `finishExecute` for cleaning up the renderer for the next render frame.

The `FeatureRenderer` is also `AutoCloseable` in case the renderer stores allocations that need to be released.

If your `SubmitNode` contains a `RenderType`, then you can extend `RenderTypeFeatureRenderer` instead. `RenderTypeFeatureRenderer` functions similarly to the now removed `MultiBufferSource`, where within `buildGroup`, the `VertexConsumer` can be obtained from the render type via `getVertexBuffer`, which can then be written to.

```
public class ExampleFeatureRenderer extends RenderTypeFeatureRenderer<ExampleSubmit> {    // The unique identifier that represents this feature renderer.    public static final FeatureRendererType<ExampleSubmit> TYPE = FeatureRenderer.type("examplemod:example_submit");    @Override    protected void buildGroup(FeatureFrameContext context, List<ExampleSubmit> submits) {        // For each submit        for (ExampleSubmit submit : submits) {            // Get the `VertexConsumer` to write to            VertexConsumer builder = this.getVertexBuilder(submit.renderType());                        // Write the vertex data            builder.addVertex(...);        }    }}
```

From there, everything just needs to be linked together.

First, `SubmitNode#featureType` must return the renderer to use:

```
public record ExampleSubmit(Matrix4fc pose, RenderType type, ...) implements TranslucentSubmit, BatchableSubmit {    @Override    public FeatureRendererType<? extends TranslucentSubmit> featureType() {        // The identifier for our feature renderer.        return ExampleFeatureRenderer.TYPE;    }}
```

Then, the `FeatureRenderer` must be linked to its type in `FeatureRendererDispatcher`:

```
// Assume we can inject into the end of the `FeatureRendererDispatcher` constructor// and that `featureRenderers` is accessible.public FeatureRenderDispatcher(...) {    // Injecting into the tail    this.featureRenderers.put(ExampleFeatureRenderer.TYPE, new ExampleFeatureRenderer());}
```

And, if you created a new `FeatureRenderPhase`, you will need to add the phase for execution within `FeatureRenderDispatcher$PreparedFrame`:

```
// Assume we can inject into `FeatureRenderDispatcher$PreparedFrame`// Since our render phase contains translucent elements, we will somehow inject// into `executeTranslucent` before gizmos.public void executeTranslucent() {    // ...    for (SubmitNodeCollection collection : submitNodeStorage.getSubmitsPerOrder().values()) {        // ...        this.executePhase(collection.shapeOutlines, context);        // Add our own phase here        this.executePhase(collection.examplePhase, context);        this.executePhase(collection.gizmos, context);    }    // ...}
```

### Dispatching Picture-In-Picture[​](#dispatching-picture-in-picture "Direct link to Dispatching Picture-In-Picture")

Direct access to the `MultiBufferSource$BufferSource` has been removed from the `PictureInPictureRenderer`. Instead `prepare` now takes in the `FeatureRenderDispatcher` to render the elements to a texture, while `renderToTexture` takes in the `SubmitNodeCollector`.

```
public class ExamplePIPRenderer extends PictureInPictureRenderer<ExamplePIPRenderState> {    // The constructor is no longer required as it doesn't take in the `MultiBufferSource$BufferSource`.    @Override    protected void renderToTexture(ExamplePIPRenderState renderState, PoseStack poseStack, SubmitNodeCollector submitNodeCollector) {        // Submit elements to render to the texture here.    }    // ...}
```

### Shape Outlines Feature[​](#shape-outlines-feature "Direct link to Shape Outlines Feature")

Shape outlines is a new render feature that replaces `ShapeRenderer`, allowing for the outline of a `VoxelShape` to be rendered via `OrderedSubmitNodeCollector#submitShapeOutline`. This takes in the `PoseStack` of where the element should be placed, the `VoxelShape` to render, the `RenderType` to use, the `color` of the outline, the `width` of the line being outlined, and whether it should be rendered before or after the translucent terrain is rendered.

## Object Collections[​](#object-collections "Direct link to Object Collections")

Many vanilla objects can be considered variants of each other but are independent in nature (e.g. different colors, different copper states). Given that most of these objects have the same properties and components, vanilla created object collections to store all the variants together and operate upon them at once. As such, fields within certain registries have been condensed into a single collection (e.g. `Items#_*DYE` is now a `Items#DYE` collection).

Vanilla currently provides two collections: a `ColorCollection` for all 16 dye colors, and `WeatheringCopperCollection` for weathered and waxed blocks. The collections can be created through the constructor, but there are static constructors for blocks (`registerBlocks`) and items (`registerItems`). The collection also contain methods for common usecases, like looping through each entry (`forEach`) or picking a specific entry from its collection method (`pick`).

```
// Create colored blockspublic static final ColorCollection<Block> EXAMPLE_BLOCK = ColorCollection.registerBlocks(    // The base identifier for the blocks.    // The colors will be prefixed when creating (e.g. 'white_example_block').    "example_block",    // The method to register the block. Takes in:    // - The name created from the identifier.    // - The factory taking in the properties to create the block.    // - The block properties.    // And returns the block.    (name, factory, props) -> Registry.register(        BuiltInRegistries.BLOCK,        Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", name),        factory.apply(props)    ),    // The factory that creates the block. Takes in:    // - The dye color applied to the block.    // - The block properties.    // And returns the block.    (color, props) -> new Block(props),    // Supplies the properties for the given color. Takes in:    // - The dye color applied to the block.    // And returns the block properties.    color -> BlockBehavior.Properties.of());// Do something for each object in the collectionEXAMPLE_BLOCK.forEach(block -> {    // ...});// Map a collection to another collectionColorCollection<Item> items = ColorCollection.map(Block::asItem);// Map two collections together, zipping them per entryColorCollection<Item> items = ColorCollection.zipMap(EXAMPLE_BLOCK, ColorCollection.VALUES, (exampleBlock, dyeColor) -> {    val id = BuiltInRegistries.BLOCK.getKey(exampleBlock);    return Registry.register(        BuiltInRegistries.ITEM, id,        new Item(new Item.Properties()            .setId(ResourceKey.create(BuiltInRegistries.ITEM, id))            .component(DataComponents.DYED_COLOR, new DyedItemColor(dyeColor.getTextureDiffuseColor))        )    );});// Do something given two collections, zipping them per entryColorCollection.zipApply(EXAMPLE_BLOCK, Items.DYE, (exampleBlock, dye) -> {    // ...});// Get a specific object based on the collection variantBlock pink = EXAMPLE_BLOCK.pick(DyeColor.PINK);

## Advancements and Entity Sub Predicates[​](#advancements-and-entity-sub-predicates "Direct link to Advancements and Entity Sub Predicates")

`net.minecraft.advancements` has reorganized the location of its criteria, triggers, and predicates. Criteria and triggers are now located within `net.minecraft.advancements.triggers`, whereas predicates can be found within `net.minecraft.advancements.predicates`. `EntityPredicate` along with `EntitySubPredicate` and its implementations are within `net.minecraft.advancements.predicates.entity`.

Additionally, `EntityPredicate` is now a wrapper around a map of `EntitySubPredicate`s. Since not all predicates used by the `EntityPredicate` were `EntitySubPredicate`s (e.g. `DistancePredicate`, `SlotsPredicate`), vanilla added new `EntitySubPredicate`s that wrap around these generic implementations (e.g. `DistancePredicate` -> `DistanceToPlayerPredicate`, `SlotsPredicate` -> `EntitySlotsPredicate`). Predicates that were recursive in nature (e.g. `vehicle`, `passenger`) also have an object to wrap around the `EntityPredicate` (e.g. `vehicle` now a `VehiclePredicate`, `passenger` now a `PassengerPredicate`).

`EntitySubPredicate` has also changed slightly as its now just a functional interface with `matches`. `Registries#ENTITY_SUB_PREDICATE_TYPE` now registers a `Codec` of the predicate, which is used as the key of the `EntityPredicate` map.

```
// Create a sub predicate to map.public class TeamColorPredicate(int color) implements EntitySubPredicate {    // The codec to register.    public static final Codec<TeamColorPredicate> CODEC = ExtraCodecs.STRING_RGB_COLOR.xmap(        TeamColorPredicate::new, TeamColorPredicate::color    );    public TeamColorPredicate {        this.color = ARGB.opaque(color);    }    @Override    public boolean matches(Entity entity, ServerLevel level, @Nullable Vec3 position) {        return ARGB.opaque(entity.getTeamColor()) == this.color;    }}// Register the codec.Registry.register(    BuiltInRegistries.ENTITY_SUB_PREDICATE_TYPE,    Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "team_color"),    TeamColorPredicate.CODEC);
```

So, if our `EntityPredicate` looks something like:

```
var predicate = new EntityPredicate(Map.of(    TeamColorPredicate.CODEC, new TeamColorPredicate(0x00FF00),    DistanceToPlayerPredicate.CODEC, new DistanceToPlayerPredicate(DistancePredicate.vertical(MinMaxBounds.Doubles.exactly(1d)))));
```

Then, it will be serialized into the advancement JSON as:

```
// In some advancement JSON// Only the `EntityPredicate` part{    "examplemod:team_color": "#00FF00",    "minecraft:distance": {        "y": 1    }}
```

## More Resource Keys and Separating Registry Objects[​](#more-resource-keys-and-separating-registry-objects "Direct link to More Resource Keys and Separating Registry Objects")

`Block`s, `Item`s, `EntityType`s, `BlockEntityType`s, `Fluid`s, and `Potion`s have had their `ResourceKey`s stored in a separate `*Ids` class, which is then referenced whenever an identifier is needed. Blocks with an item representation, known as block items, have their own identifiers stored as a `BlockItemId`, which is just a pair of `ResourceKey`s, in `BlockItemIds`.

Additionally, the `BlockEntityType` and `EntityType` registry entries have been moved into their own separate class: `BlockEntityTypes` and `EntityTypes`, respectively.

### Tags Provider Changes[​](#tags-provider-changes "Direct link to Tags Provider Changes")

Since all registry objects in a tag has an accessible `ResourceKey`, all utility subclasses of `TagsProvider` have been removed (i.e. `HolderTagProvider`, `IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider`, `KeyTagProvider`), with the two `KeyTagProvider#tag` methods moved into `TagsProvider`. In addition, the `TagAppender` now only takes in `ResourceKey`s, the arbitrary element mapping completely removed.

This means that either a `ResourceKey` or `TagKey` must be provided to add an element to a tag through `TagsProvider`s.

For block items and block item tags (tags that exist within the block and item registry), `BlockItemTagsProvider` has been updated to use `BlockItemId`s and `BlockItemTagId`s, which are functionally records that hold the names of the object in the block and item registries. Entries are added in the `run` block, which is then called within the block or item `TagsProvider`, respectively.

-   `net.minecraft.data.tags`
    -   All `*TagsProvider` that extended `TagsProvider` or one of its subclasses now extend `TagsProvider`
    -   `BlockItemTagAppender` - A `TagAppender` that converts a `BlockItemId` to its appropriate object resource key, usually for a `Block` or `Item`.

        -   `wrapForBlocks`, `wrapForItems` - Wraps around an existing block or item `TagAppender` to take in a `BlockItemId` or `BlockItemTagId`.
        -   `$CombinedAppender` - An appender that allows for `BlockItemId`s and `BlockItemTagId`s to be added.
    -   `HolderTagProvider` class is removed
    -   `IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider` class is removed
    -   `KeyTagProvider` class is removed

## Minor Migrations[​](#minor-migrations "Direct link to Minor Migrations")

The following is a list of useful or interesting additions, changes, and removals that do not deserve their own section in the primer.

### Sulfur Cube Archetypes[​](#sulfur-cube-archetypes "Direct link to Sulfur Cube Archetypes")

Sulfur cubes behave differently depending on the item it absorbed. What behavior the cube exhibits depends on the `SulfurCubeArchetype`, a datapack registry object, containing the corresponding `Item`.

```
// A file located at:// - `data/examplemod/sulfur_cube_archetype/example_archetype.json`{    // The held items the sulfur cube must contain for this archetype to apply.    // Can either be an item id, such as "minecraft:apple",    // or a list of item ids, such as ["minecraft:apple", "minecraft:carrot", ...],    // or an entity type tag, such as "#minecraft:sulfur_cube_food".    "items": "#minecraft:sulfur_cube_food",    // A list of attribute modifiers to apply to the sulfur cube when holding    // the item.    "attribute_modifiers": [        {            // A unique identifier representing the modifier.            "id": "examplemod:example_arch_add_resistance",            // The registry name of the attribute to apply.            "attribute": "minecraft:knockback_resistance",            // The amount to modify the attribute value.            "amount": -2.0,            // The operation to use when applying the modifier.            // - 'add_value': Adds the amount to the current value.            // - 'add_multiplied_base': Multiplies the amount to the base value after additions.            // - 'add_multiplied_total': Multiplies the amount to the value after all modifications.            "operation": "add_value"        }    ],    // When `true`, the sulfur cube will float in liquids.    "buoyant": true,    // When present, a sulfur cube can be primed.    "explosion": {        // The maximum radius of the explosion. (e.g., 4.0 for regular tnt)        "power": 4,        // When `true`, the explosion can set other blocks on fire.        "causes_fire": true,        // The number of ticks before the sulfur cube explodes.        "fuse": 120    },    // When present, the sulfur cube will deal damage to entities it comes in contact with.    "contact_damage": {        // The float provider specifying how many half-hearts to remove.        "amount": 2,        // The registry name of the damage type.        "damage_type": "minecraft:cactus",        // When `true`, the damage is attributed to the sulfur cube.        "attribute_to_source": false    },    // Specifies the knockback the sulfur cube receives when hit.    "knockback_modifiers": {        // The base delta movement to apply along the XZ axis.        "horizontal_power": 0.33,        // The base delta movement to apply along the Y axis.        "vertical_power": 0.06    },    // Specifies the sounds made by the sulfur cube.    "sound_settings": {        // The sound made when the sulfur cube receives knockback (on hit).        "hit_sound": "minecraft:entity.sulfur_cube.regular.hit",        // The sound made whent the sulfur cube collides with the player's pickup area.        "push_sound": "minecraft:entity.sulfur_cube.regular.push",        // The number of seconds to wait before playing the push sound again.        "push_sound_cooldown": 0.5,        // The square root of the velocity threshold for the push sound to be played.        "push_sound_impulse_threshold": 0.2    }}
```

-   `net.minecraft.core.registries.Registries#SULFUR_CUBE_ARCHETYPE` - A resource key for the archetypes of a sulfur cube.
-   `net.minecraft.world.entity`
    -   `SulfurCubeArchetype` - The behavior of a sulfur cube when holding the given item.
    -   `SulfurCubeArchetypes` - All vanilla sulfur cube archetypes.
-   `net.minecraft.world.item.component.SulfurCubeContent` - The absorbed block stored in the sulfur cube.

### Shears Breaking Speed[​](#shears-breaking-speed "Direct link to Shears Breaking Speed")

Shears now use three tags to determine how fast it should break an block:

-   `minecraft:shears_extreme_breaking_speed` - Blocks are mined with a base of `15` speed, higher than all other vanilla tools.
-   `minecraft:shears_major_breaking_speed` - Blocks are mined with a base of `5` speed, the same speed as copper tools.
-   `minecraft:shears_minor_breaking_speed` - Blocks are mined with a base of `2` speed, the same speed as wooden tools.

Cobweb is the only block hardcoded to use the extreme breaking speed value.

-   `net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity#attemptToShearEquipment` -> `Mob#attemptToShearEquipment`, `shearItem`; now `protected` from `private`

### Structure Processor Unrolling[​](#structure-processor-unrolling "Direct link to Structure Processor Unrolling")

`StructureProcessor`s no longer use `StructureProcessorType` as its registered instance, instead now directly using the `MapCodec` used as part of the serialization and deserialization process. `StructureProcessor` is no longer as a class as well, instead being represented by an interface. As such, all new processors should implement the `StructureProcessor` interface, replacing `getType` with `codec`:

```
public class ExampleProcessor implements StructureProcessor {    // Create the map codec to register    public static final MapCodec<ExampleProcessor> MAP_CODEC = MapCodec.unit(ExampleProcessor::new);    @Nullable    @Override    public StructureTemplate.StructureBlockInfo processBlock(LevelReader level, BlockPos targetPosition, BlockPos referencePos, StructureTemplate.StructureBlockInfo originalBlockInfo, StructureTemplate.StructureBlockInfo processedBlockInfo, StructurePlaceSettings settings) {        // Modify the structure block info        return processedBlockInfo;    }    // Replaces getType    @Override    public MapCodec<ExampleProcessor> codec() {        return MAP_CODEC;    }}// Register the map codec to the registryRegistry.register(BuiltInRegistries.STRUCTURE_PROCESSOR, Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_processor"), ExampleProcessor.MAP_CODEC);
```

-   `net.minecraft.core.registries.BuiltInRegistries`, `Registries`
    -   `STRUCTURE_PROCESSOR` now holds a `StructureProcessor` map codec instead of a `StructureProcessorType`
-   `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.structure.templatesystem`
    -   All classes now implement `StructureProcessor` instead of extending
    -   `CODEC` fields are renamed to `MAP_CODEC`
    -   `ProtectedBlockProcessor` is now a `record`
        -   `cannotReplace` now takes in a `HolderSet` of `Block`s instead of the referenced `TagKey`
    -   `StructureProcessor` is now an `interface` instead of a `class`
        -   `getType` -> `codec`, now returning a `MapCodec`
    -   `StructureProcessorType` no longer has a generic
        -   Fields for each type are now inlined into `StructureProcessorTypes#bootstrap`
        -   `codec` -> `StructureProcessor#codec`
        -   `register` inlined into `StructureProcessorTypes#bootstrap`
    -   `StructureProcessorTypes` - All vanilla structure processor codecs.

### Game Test Entity Builders[​](#game-test-entity-builders "Direct link to Game Test Entity Builders")

With the growing number of setup entities require when spawning for a game test, vanilla has split the construction of such entities into builder classes: `GameTestEntityBuilder` for generic entities, and `GameTestMobBuilder` for mobs. The builders can be acquired by calling `spawnEntity` and `spawnMob`, respectively, taking in the `EntityType` and some relative position in the test.

```
// For some game test...public void exampleTest(GameTestHelper helper) {    // Spawn an entity    ArmorStand entity = helper.spawnEntity(EntityType.ARMOR_STAND, 0, 0, 0)        // Why the entity has spawned.        .spawnReason(EntitySpawnReason.SPAWN_ITEM_USE)        // How the entity should be rotated relative to the test.        .rotation(Rotation.CLOCKWISE_90)        // Whether the entity should be persisted.        .requirePersistence(true)        // Spawn the entity.        .spawn();        // Spawn a mob    Pig mob = helper.spawnMob(EntityType.PIG, 1, 0, 1)        // Spawns the entity with no AI.        .withNoFreeWill()        // Can use the entity builder methods.        .spawnReason(EntitySpawnReason.NATURAL)        .spawn();}
